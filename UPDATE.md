# 🌟 Habitat Rain - Update Log

## Version 3.0.3 (Upcoming)

### 🔥 New Features
- **Plugin Activity Tracking**: Introduced an `isPluginActive` variable to ensure settings changes are saved but not applied when the plugin is inactive. This prevents unintended behavior when modifying settings while the plugin is stopped.
