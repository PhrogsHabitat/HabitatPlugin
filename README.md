# HabitatRain & Infinite Plugins for Discord

Welcome to the **HabitatRain** and **Infinite** plugins, designed to transform your Discord experience with immersive visuals and effects. These plugins are built for **Vencord**, a Discord client mod, and offer unique features like rain effects, cosmic stardust, dynamic backgrounds, and now dynamic weather and mist effects. While these plugins aim to enhance your aesthetic experience, they are resource-intensive and may cause performance issues on some systems.
